GENETIC ALGORITHMS

• Canon (1932) was probably the first to understand evolution as a
learning mechanism completely different to the ones performed
by individuals which are mostly based on trial and error.
• Notice that humans are able to learn because, in fact, we belong
to a class of “computing machines” capable of doing so and that
this ability is just the resuld of evolution.
• Turing (1950) also noted the “obvious connection between
machine learning and evolution”, envisioning the use of
principles of evolution in the construction of thinking machines.
• Evolutionay algorithms are a powerful alternative way to
understand learning and they offer an alternative where classic
techniques such as gradient descent or purely random search
have proven unsatisfactory.
• Genetic Algorithms (GA) are heuristic search techniques based
on the principles of natural evolution which were enunciated by
Darwin in The Origin of Species in 1859.
• According to such principles, natural selection stablishes a link
between the performance of the living beings and the
chomosomes that encode their genetic information.
• The process of natural selection has the result that chromosomes
which encode successful characteristics to reproduce more
frequently than those who do not.

• GA were fist proposed by Holland in 1962 but only after 1975
with the publication of his book Adaptation in Natural and
Artificial Systems they became relatively popular.
• Other proposals such as Evolutionary Programming (Fogel et al,
1966), Evolution Strategies (Rechenberg, 1971; Schewefel, 1974)
or, more recently, Genetic Programming (Koza, 1992) share
similar ideas consisting on applying principles of Evolution to the
solution of general problems.
• Similarly as with other ML techiniques such as ANNs, GAs are just
algorithmic abstractions with few or no relationship with the real
processes they emulate.

• Notice that in all the algorithms previously seen, the modification of
the solution is done directly.
• Contrary to this, Evolution is a biological process that operates on
the chromosomes rather than on their biological expression (the
living beign they encode)
• In contrast, GA operate on coded versions of the solutions, this is a
paramount diference of GAs, one of its strenghts but also one of its
drawbacks.
• In effect, since encoding is so important, the performance of the
algorith strongly depends on finding such ecoding that support
easily the search procedures.
• Encoding is, in the words of some practitioners, more an art than a
science and it car reveal or destroy the power of GA.

• Another important diference of GA aganist more
“clasical”
procedures is that GA are inherently parallel.
• Most of the algorithms try to find improved versions of an initial
solution while GA search for a whole set of better solutions.
• In this sense, GA implement not only a search in depth but also a
search in breadth.
• For GAs it is not essential to find, at some iteration, a solution that it
is better than the previous one but to find one set of solutions
which, globaly, are better than the preceeding.

• GA fall under the class of heuristic algorithms, even though some
convergence results exist, it can not be generally demonstrated that
they converge to the global (or even local) optimum.
• Nevertheless they have show their flexibility and power in many
applications that range from Finance to Electronics.
• GA are also robust and accept post-optimality analyses in a natural
fashion: when the objective function changes significant parts of the
algorithms are reusable, in contrats with other methods that require
a full re-writting of the procedures and code.
• Finally, as we shall see, GA are non deterministic but stochastic, i.e.
every time they are run on a particular problem they can provide
different solutions
• In its most basic form GA employ three operators: Selection,
Crossover and Mutation.
• These operators mimic the ones found in Genetics, which is also
the source for many other operators: diplodism, parasitism,
elitism, etc.
• GA are conceptually very simple and can be better explained
with a simple example taken from (Goldberg, 1996).
